//signup from google
Yes, with the provided frontend component and backend code, you should be able to perform a successful sign-up from Google. Here's how the flow works:

1. When the user clicks on the "Sign up with Google" button, it triggers the `signIn` function from the `useGoogleLogin` hook.
2. The user is prompted to sign in with their Google account.
3. Once the user is successfully authenticated, the `onUserLoaded` callback is triggered, and the user object containing the authentication tokens and profile information is passed as an argument.
4. In the `onUserLoaded` callback, the user's information is extracted, including the `id_token` (socialMediaAccessToken), `name`, and `email`.
5. The extracted information is sent as a POST request to your backend endpoint (`localhost:3000/user/signup`) to perform the sign-up process.
6. In the backend, the `signup` controller receives the request and checks if the user already exists.
7. If the user doesn't exist and the `socialMediaProvider` is "google", the `getUserProfileFromSocialMediaAPIGoogle` function is called to verify and retrieve the user's profile information using the `idToken` (socialMediaAccessToken).
8. The verified profile information is used to create a new user in the database.
9. The backend sends a response back to the frontend indicating whether the sign-up was successful or not.
10. In the frontend, the response is handled accordingly, and any additional actions can be performed.

Overall, this flow should allow users to sign up using their Google accounts successfully. Just make sure to provide the correct values for `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` on both the frontend and backend to ensure the integration with the Google API works properly.
